## Getting Started
These instructions will ensure you have everything needed to develop and build Candy Reaper on your local machine. If, for any reason, you followed these instructions to the end and you encounter errors, send a message in the project's Slack channel. 
***NOTE***: This is stil a WIP.

### Prerequisites
- [Unreal Engine 4.20.3](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) (*Game engine*)
- Visual Studio with C++ Tools ([VS2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is recommended) (*IDE for C++*)
- [Slack](https://fortworthgamedev.slack.com/messages/C8MHLSPLY) (*For project discussion and news*)
- Git (*For version control*)

#### Installing Unreal Engine
The link provided above will take you to the Unreal Enginge 4 landing page. In the top right corner, there should be a blue download button. You'll download the Epic Games Launcher installer. Once installed, launch the launcher and log in. You may have to create an Epic account. Near the top of the window, you'll see a tab called **Unreal Engine**. With that tab focused, on the left you'll see more tabs; click on the **Library** tab. There'll be 3 sections: **Engine Versions**, **My Projects**, and  **Vault**. If you don't have any Unreal Engines installed, you'll see a gray box to install engine version 4.20.3. Click on the version number to find and select version **4.20.3**. 

#### Associating Project with Unreal
In order to associate the game with your Unreal launcher, you must first launch Unreal Engine 4.20.3. The Unreal Project Browser will pop up. In the bottom left, click **Browse**. Navigate to the game repo on your machine and open the game Unreal Enginge Project File. It will open the project editor. Back in the Epic Games Launcher, you should now see game under **My Projects**. 

#### Installing Visual Studio 2017 with C++ Tools
If you don't have any version of Visual Studio on your machine, it is recommended that you download and install Visual Studio Community 2017. Following the link above will take you to the download page for it. Once you download the Visual Studio Installer, you'll want to install Visual Studio Community 2017. It will prompt you for workloads (essentially packages and tools for various develoment targets). You'll want to make sure *Desktop Development with C++* and *Game Development with C++* are checked, then proceed to install. 

#### Joining the Project Channel
For this project, we'll be using Slack as our platform of discussion and conversation. News, ideas, suggestions and assistance will be posted in the October channel. Chances are, if you have access to this repo, you've already been invited to the server. If you haven't, contact Lance. 


#### Installing Git
We'll be using Git for our VCS (*hence this repo being on GitHub...*). If you aren't familiar with Git, it is recommended you install a third-party Git GUI. Those can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). SourceTree and GitHub Desktop are the more popular ones. We have contributors who use either one or the other, so we'll be able to better help you troubleshoot any Git problems if you use one of those two.
